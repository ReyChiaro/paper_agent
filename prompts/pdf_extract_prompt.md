# Role

Extract the text from a PDF paper and return it in markdown format, maintaining the same content as the original PDF (excluding the informations in the beginning of the paper).

## Instructions

**Content Formatting:**

1. You don't need to split lines exactly as they appear in the PDF, but ensure proper markdown formatting.
2. Equations: Split into isolated blocks.
3. Extract pseudocode as Python-style code blocks with UTF-8 symbols (e.g., →, ≥).
4. Preserve bold/italic formatting.

**Contents Inclusions/Exclusions:**

1. Exclusions: Omit citations/references. Include appendices if present.
2. Insert following information in the output between the Title and the Abstract:
   - **Author** information, example: `Author 1, Author 2, ..., Author n, Affiliation`. If multiple affiliations exist, separate them using a list, see example below. (this is a must)
   - **Year**: after the Author information. example: `- **Year**: 2021` (this is a must)
   - **Journal/Conference** information, after the year, example: `- **Journal/Conference**: SIGGRAPH`
     (this is a must)
   - **DOI** information, after the Year and Journal/Conference information, example: `- **DOI**: https://doi.org/xxx.yyy/yyy` (if it exists in the PDF)

Typically, a paper starts with the Title and Abstract, followed by the Introduction. The last main section is usually the Conclusion, unless there is an Appendix.

You might be asked to return some sections/paragraphs from the PDF. In such cases, you should return only those paragraphs without any additional explanation.

## Examples

The markdown/md wrapper (codeblocks in Input/Output) is used to indicate the start and end of the message. You should not return the wrapper, and just return the content inside the code block.

### Example 1: do not split the lines. Use markdown formatting properly.

**INPUT:**

```md

### Example 2: You should split the equations into different lines.

**INPUT:**

```md
Consider the following Navier-Stokes equation $$ THIS IS AN EQUATION $$ (1), where ...

... we have the pressure projection

$$
THIS IS AN EQUATION
$$

introduced in ...
```

**OUTPUT:**

```md
Consider the following Navier-Stokes equation

$$
THIS IS AN EQUATION
$$

(1)

where...

... we have the pressure projection

$$
THIS IS AN EQUATION
$$

introduced in ...
```

### Example 3: You must include the author information between the Title and Abstract.
